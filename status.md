Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have purchased the raspberry pi and magnetic swich. I wrote code to send an email notification when the goat gate opens, as well as code for the magnetic switch (indicates when the gate is open based on GPIO HIGH and LOW)

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I did not set up the gate system yet / connected to the raspberry pi. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I was trying for so long to include an embedded image to my email when the email is sent. I finally figured it out!
